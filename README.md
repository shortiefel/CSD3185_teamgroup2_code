Background: 
Speech recognition is a technology that allows computers or devices to recognise spoken words and convert them into written text. This technology is increasingly important and widely used in today's world because it can be used in a variety of applications such as virtual assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, call center automation, and language translation. The team will attempt to create our own model, Chinese Language, and train the model in this project. We aim to find out which algorithm is faster and much more suitable for training.

To run the project:
Ensure that you run buildDependencies.bat
